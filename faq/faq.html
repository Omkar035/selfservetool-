 Event Flow<br>

<p style="font-weight: 600;"> Auction Won → Ad Call → Ad assets Render → DCM tracker triggers (Concurrent)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600;">  Impression tracking</p>
Ad servers and DSPs have different measurement tech. And based on the dynamic variables like fraud, viewability, latency in bids, load times the impression counts differ.<br>Specifically for mobile app impressions, CM360 is likely to overcount significantly relative to the DSP provided that the DSP counts on a notification fired when the ad is displayed (not when the ad markup is downloaded but not yet displayed by the app). In app environments, it can be expected that the markup loads far more often than actual "impressions" according to that criteria, especially for interstitials and popup creatives where the creative might not ever come to happen.<br><br>HC tech just creates a holder for the CM tracker. HC tech isn't in any way involved in measurement of impressions by CM. CM has their own method and tech to measure impressions.<br>

Short Session Times: Consumer’s behavior on mobile devices, especially smartphones, is different than when sitting in front of a computer browsing the web. There are more scenarios when a user may launch an app or a website to quickly check something and then close out. In these abbreviated sessions not all parties tracking calls may be called or complete before the consumer exits the app or browser.<br>

      <a>DV360 impression Discrepancy</a>
      <div class="content">
        <div>
         <h4> Discrepancy in impressions - HC adserver vs DSP DV360</h4>

The difference in impressions is based on how ad technologies calculate and reconcile their ad request. (Impression definition is different depending on technologies.)<br><br>

<b> Auction → ad Call/request → ad served HC (HC impressions) - served ad reconciled as billable impression (DV360 Impression)</b> <br><br>

For DV360 - Impressions are billable entities and reconciled basis different filters - <b> ad not rendered, fraud, viewability, above/below fold etc.</b><br><br>

Hockeycurve doesn't provide the above features and considers all ad requests as impressions.<br><br>

<b> DV360/AdX help doc</b>
All ad calls are not considered as an impression for billing by DSP/Ad exchange. - <a class="doc" href="https://support.google.com/authorizedbuyers/answer/6156722?hl=en#ads-not-rendered"> https://support.google.com/authorizedbuyers/answer/6156722?hl=en#ads-not-rendered</a><br>

<b>For display creatives:</b>
Once an auction is won, the Publisher requests an ad and intends to display it, but the ad fails to render for multiple reasons (e.g. user navigates away, poor network connection, etc.)<br><br>

<b> For mobile app creatives:</b><br>
Publisher requests an ad but never actually shows ad (ad is downloaded in preparation for an ad break, but the ad is never given a chance to be shown) - poor connection, user stops the app load etc<br><br>

<b>How much discrepancy? </b> <br>
Device environment wise it varies mobile environment sees anywhere between 50-60% discrepancy depending on the publisher, deal type and scale of the campaign. <br><br>

<b>If deep details are required - </b> <br>
Auctions won data available under report section of DSPs, you can compare and see the difference between auction won and impressions for billing.<br><br>

<b>Conclusion-</b>
With the nature of the real time bid protocol each time ad call is made adserver has to render the content and it reports the impression. Hence, as a practice at Hockeycurve we use the DSP impressions for billing because DSP has the final reconciled amount of impressions bought from the exchange.<br>

       <div>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;"> AD Size</p>
        <ul>
       <li> Create separate Line-items (LIs) for different ad sizes.</li>
       <b> for e.g.</b> Create separate LIs for 300x250 vs 300x600
       <li> If all creatives are attached to the same LI budget, it gets spent on creative with most inventory.</li>
       <b> for e.g.</b> 320x50 & 300x250 will get 80-90% of budget</ul>
        
       <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;"> Viewability</p>
       <ul>
        <li>  Add viewability filter. DV360 gives option to add filter on viewability..</li>
          <li> Keep Line-item (LI) viewability filter above 70%.</li>
            <li> Low or No viewability, ad inventory will result in poor CTR.</li></ul>
        
            <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;">  Goal/Target</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Set your goal targets carefully. </li></ul>
      <b>  for e.g. </b>if you are setting up rs. 200 CPT target, algo will optimize to achieve equal or lower than 200.
        
        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-weight: 600;"> Time of day Spending</p>
        <ul>
          <li> For moment marketing campaigns the delivery should be evenly distributed across all hours of the campaign.</li>
            <li> Hence, check your hourly report daily to see if the impressions are bought evenly across all campaign hours.</li>
              <li> HC Recommendation Model suggests 75-80% of the Daily Impressions should happen on the During Match Hours (On Live Moments). </li>
                <li>Remaining 25-20% impressions to happen throughout the day.</li></ul>
        
      <b> for e.g.</b>  If a Cricket Match is at 8pm, So daily Budget should be set up in a way that from 12 am to 7:30 pm only 15-20% of the daily impressions is bought, so that from 7:30pm to 11:30pm 75-80% Impressions are done.<br>
        
        So that the campaign should not face issue of key match hours didn't get impressions as the daily budget got exhausted before the match started and Whole of the media buying happened on a default Creative.
